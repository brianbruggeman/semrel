# semrel

A semantic release tool

## Motivation

After spending way too much time attempting to figure out the perfect combination of configuration for semantic-release using cargo, I'm just going to go ahead and write my own.

## Usage

```bash
semrel
```

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://api.github.com/repos/brianbruggeman/semrel
```
