# Future work

Rather than having a roadmap, these are a list of ideas that should be explored.

- [ ] Generating commits, tags, etc. to simplify workflows
- [ ] Adding a github action to automatically update the manifest file
- [ ] Adding support for Rust workspaces and monorepos
- [ ] Pattern matching for commit messages
- [ ] Release notes templates
- [ ] More care and consideration for using semrel as a library
- [ ] Consider scope as a configurable control mechanism for bumping versions
